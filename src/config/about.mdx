### Hey there, I'm Tarunesh

I grew up in India, chasing middle-class dreams and learning to be grateful for everything along the way.
I’ve been doing computers pretty much all my life and currently working as a software engineer. It is been both my passion and  profession.
Been enjoying what I do—and if you want to talk code, I’m all ears.

Outside of tech, fitness has become a huge part of my life over the past two years.
It’s what keeps me growing, glowing, and feeling alive.
I try to follow the [8/8/8](https://37signals.com/08) rule: 8 hours of work, 8 hours of life, and 8 hours of sleep.
It’s not always perfect, but it’s a framework that keeps me balanced.

Sometimes I feel a little lost in space—but in a good way.
I’m free, and maybe that’s why I feel lost. I never wanted to work the way everyone else did.
I wanted to be obsessed with what I worked on. That kind of freedom can be chaotic, but honestly, I wouldn’t have it any other way.
